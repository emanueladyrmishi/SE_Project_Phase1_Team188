# Project Details

## Project Title:
Drive-Smart


## Problem Statement:
Every day, the need for mobility increases, and using a car remains one of the most convenient options. Personal vehicles offer comfort, flexibility, and the ability to travel according to personal schedules. Additionally, Albania has seen a rise in tourism, with visitors seeking safe and cost-effective transportation.

During peak seasons, public transportation and taxis face challenges, including overcrowding and unavailability. As a result, car rental services have gained popularity among locals and foreigners. However, many businesses in this sector lack proper marketing, with most operating only through incomplete Instagram pages that fail to provide essential information such as pricing, schedules, and availability. This often leads to customer frustration and abandoned rental attempts.


## Solution Proposed: 
To improve travel experiences, we propose Drive-Smart, an application that allows users to rent cars easily and securely. The platform will offer a streamlined reservation process, providing detailed information about available vehicles, rental prices, and booking schedules. This ensures convenience for both customers and rental businesses.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** The purpose of Drive-Smart is to offer an innovative and user-friendly application that simplifies the car rental process while ensuring excellent service. Our goal is to provide a diverse range of vehicles that meet customers’ preferences and needs.

  - **Main Objectives:** 1. Simplify the car rental process
2. Ensure security and reliability
3. Implement technological innovation
4. Provide transparency in pricing and availability

## Application Description: 
Drive-Smart is designed to streamline car rental reservations, offering users a faster and more efficient way to secure a vehicle. The platform aims to address customer pain points and enhance their rental experience.

## Phase II: User Requirements and Application Specifications
## Submission Deadline: 26.03.2025, 23:59

1. Chosen Development Model:
Waterfall

Justification:
The systematic and sequential approach of waterfall development, which can be
advantageous for projects with clearly specified and solid needs up front, is the reason
why the automobile rental application was developed using this methodology. Within the
automobile rental sector, where specifications might not alter regularly and a thorough
plan can be created beforehand, Waterfall offers an organised approach to moving
through several project stages.

Requirements Gathering:
In the Waterfall approach, compiling and recording all of the prerequisites for the
vehicle rental application is the first step. Understanding user requirements, desirable
features, and corporate goals are all part of this. During this stage, stakeholders including
administrators, clients, and end users offer their opinions.

Design:
The process starts as soon as the criteria are decided upon. This entails drafting
comprehensive requirements for the database design, user interface, and system
architecture. The application&#39;s functionality and layout are visualised through the
creation of wireframes and mockups.
Implementation:
After receiving the design specifications, the development team begins writing the
programme in accordance with the specified specifications. The entire vehicle rental
application is made up of all the system&#39;s built-in components.
Testing:
Extensive testing is carried out following the implementation phase to guarantee that the
application satisfies the requirements and operates as intended. To find and address any
faults or problems, this comprises unit, integration, and system testing.

Deployment:
The application is put into production environments after testing is finished and it is
judged ready for public release. This include configuring databases, setting up servers,
and granting end users access to the application.
Maintenance:
When an application is deployed, it goes into a maintenance phase where any updates,
patches, or repairs that are required are performed. This guarantees that the application
will function efficiently and without interruption over time.
