# Project Details

## Project Title:
Drive-Smart


## Problem Statement:
Every day, the need for mobility increases, and using a car remains one of the most convenient options. Personal vehicles offer comfort, flexibility, and the ability to travel according to personal schedules. Additionally, Albania has seen a rise in tourism, with visitors seeking safe and cost-effective transportation.

During peak seasons, public transportation and taxis face challenges, including overcrowding and unavailability. As a result, car rental services have gained popularity among locals and foreigners. However, many businesses in this sector lack proper marketing, with most operating only through incomplete Instagram pages that fail to provide essential information such as pricing, schedules, and availability. This often leads to customer frustration and abandoned rental attempts.


## Solution Proposed: 
To improve travel experiences, we propose Drive-Smart, an application that allows users to rent cars easily and securely. The platform will offer a streamlined reservation process, providing detailed information about available vehicles, rental prices, and booking schedules. This ensures convenience for both customers and rental businesses.

## Project Scope:
- **Aim:** The purpose of Drive-Smart is to offer an innovative and user-friendly application that simplifies the car rental process while ensuring excellent service. Our goal is to provide a diverse range of vehicles that meet customersâ€™ preferences and needs.

  - **Main Objectives:** 1. Simplify the car rental process
2. Ensure security and reliability
3. Implement technological innovation
4. Provide transparency in pricing and availability

## Application Description: 
Drive-Smart is designed to streamline car rental reservations, offering users a faster and more efficient way to secure a vehicle. The platform aims to address customer pain points and enhance their rental experience.
